1) When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

A remote repository seems to be very useful when I want to collaborate on a project with a coworker or team. We can all have a place to host our project and make some changes that will be visible by everyone.

2) Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You may not want having your local commit to be visible to others on your remote repository, so you have more control. Also, you may not be on your local computer all the time, but you can have access to GitHub with any Internet access.

3) Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Fork is a clone of a repository on GitHub which you can't make changes to. This is a GitHub feature. A clone is a copy of a local repository, or a copy of a remote repository on a local computer. A branch is a set of commit that are linked to each other: you have a master branch by default, and you can create another branch where you can modify your project to experiment a new feature. Later, you can merge two branches.
