1) What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

You create an empty repository. You need to do it to have a place on your computer to save commits.

2) How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is a place between the working directory and the repository. it allows to first select the files we want to send to the repository, and then send them to the repository when we are sure that we have all the files we want in the staging area.
